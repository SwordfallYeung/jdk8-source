/**
 * An implementation of {@link ReadWriteLock} supporting similar
 * semantics to {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * <p>This class has the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Acquisition order</b>
 *
 * <p>This class does not impose a reader or writer preference
 * ordering for lock access.  However, it does support an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> policy.
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b><i>Non-fair mode (default)</i></b>
 * <dd>When constructed as non-fair (the default), the order of entry
 * to the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy
 * constraints.  A nonfair lock that is continuously contended may
 * indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer threads, but
 * will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock.
 *
 * <dt><b><i>Fair mode</i></b>
 * <dd>When constructed as fair, threads contend for entry using an
 * approximately arrival-order policy. When the currently held lock
 * is released, either the longest-waiting single writer thread will
 * be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader threads
 * waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be
 * assigned the read lock.
 *
 * <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly)
 * will block if either the write lock is held, or there is a waiting
 * writer thread. The thread will not acquire the read lock until
 * after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and
 * released the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons
 * its wait, leaving one or more reader threads as the longest waiters
 * in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers will be
 * assigned the read lock.
 *
 * <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly)
 * will block unless both the read lock and write lock are free (which
 * implies there are no waiting threads).  (Note that the non-blocking
 * {@link ReadLock#tryLock()} and {@link WriteLock#tryLock()} methods
 * do not honor this fair setting and will immediately acquire the lock
 * if it is possible, regardless of waiting threads.)
 * <p>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <li><b>Reentrancy</b>
 *
 * <p>This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
 * write locks in the style of a {@link ReentrantLock}. Non-reentrant
 * readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
 * thread have been released.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not
 * vice-versa.  Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful
 * when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
 * perform reads under read locks.  If a reader tries to acquire the
 * write lock it will never succeed.
 *
 * <li><b>Lock downgrading</b>
 * <p>Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
 * by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
 * write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
 * <b>not</b> possible.
 *
 * <li><b>Interruption of lock acquisition</b>
 * <p>The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
 * acquisition.
 *
 * <li><b>{@link Condition} support</b>
 * <p>The write lock provides a {@link Condition} implementation that
 * behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
 * {@link Condition} implementation provided by
 * {@link ReentrantLock#newCondition} does for {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * This {@link Condition} can, of course, only be used with the write lock.
 *
 * <p>The read lock does not support a {@link Condition} and
 * {@code readLock().newCondition()} throws
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <li><b>Instrumentation</b>
 * <p>This class supports methods to determine whether locks
 * are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
 * system state, not for synchronization control.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usages</b>. Here is a code sketch showing how to perform
 * lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception handling is
 * particularly tricky when handling multiple locks in a non-nested
 * fashion):
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class CachedData {
 *   Object data;
 *   volatile boolean cacheValid;
 *   final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *
 *   void processCachedData() {
 *     rwl.readLock().lock();
 *     if (!cacheValid) {
 *       // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
 *       rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *       rwl.writeLock().lock();
 *       try {
 *         // Recheck state because another thread might have
 *         // acquired write lock and changed state before we did.
 *         if (!cacheValid) {
 *           data = ...
 *           cacheValid = true;
 *         }
 *         // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
 *         rwl.readLock().lock();
 *       } finally {
 *         rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     try {
 *       use(data);
 *     } finally {
 *       rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
 * uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
 * only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
 * more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
 * overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
 * is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
 * concurrently accessed.
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class RWDictionary {
 *   private final Map<String, Data> m = new TreeMap<String, Data>();
 *   private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *   private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
 *   private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();
 *
 *   public Data get(String key) {
 *     r.lock();
 *     try { return m.get(key); }
 *     finally { r.unlock(); }
 *   }
 *   public String[] allKeys() {
 *     r.lock();
 *     try { return m.keySet().toArray(); }
 *     finally { r.unlock(); }
 *   }
 *   public Data put(String key, Data value) {
 *     w.lock();
 *     try { return m.put(key, value); }
 *     finally { w.unlock(); }
 *   }
 *   public void clear() {
 *     w.lock();
 *     try { m.clear(); }
 *     finally { w.unlock(); }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 65535 recursive write locks
 * and 65535 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.

 * ReentrantLock是一种互斥的可重入锁，可用于处理并发场景下的线程安全问题。而很多时候会出现"读多写少"的情况，
 * 若用ReentrantLock会降低并发量，此时就比较适合ReentrantReadWriteLock出场了。
 *
 * ReentrantReadWriteLock是读写锁，它维护了一对锁：一个读锁，一个写锁。读锁之间是共享的，写锁是互斥的。
 * 与ReentrantLock相比，读写锁在读多写少的场景下允许更高的并发量。
 *
 * public class TestRDLock{
 *     //创建一个线程池
 *     private static ExecutorService threadPoolExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(10, 20, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100));
 *     //创建一个读写锁实例
 *     private static final ReadWriteLock readWriteLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *
 *     public static void main(String[] args){
 *         for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
 *             //这里可以尝试"读读"、"读写"和"写写"场景的代码测试
 *             threadPoolExecutor.execute(new ReadTask());
 *             threadPoolExecutor.execute(new WriteTask());
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // 写操作
 *     private static class WriteTask implements Runnable {
 *         @Override
 *         public void run(){
 *             readWriteLock.writeLock().lock();
 *             try{
 *                 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+ " 获取写锁");
 *                 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);
 *             }catch (InterruptedException e){
 *                 e.printStackTrace();
 *             }finally{
 *                 readWriteLock.writeLock().unlock();
 *                 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " 释放了写锁");
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     private static class ReadTask implements Runnable{
 *         @Override
 *         public void run(){
 *             readWriteLock.readLock().lock();
 *             try{
 *                 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " 获取读锁");
 *                 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);
 *             }catch (InterruptedException e){
 *                 e.printStackTrace();
 *             }finally{
 *                 readWriteLock.readLock().unlock();
 *                 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + "释放了读锁")
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * 场景一：更新缓存后执行锁降级
 * class CachedData{
 *     Object data;
 *     volatile boolean cacheValid;
 *     final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *
 *     void processCachedData(){
 *         // 先获取读锁
 *         rwl.readLock().lock();
 *         if(!cacheValid){
 *             rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *             rwl.writeLock().lock();
 *             try{
 *                 if(!cacheValid){
 *                     data = ...
 *                     cacheValid = true;
 *                 }
 *                 rwl.readLock().lock();
 *             }finally{
 *                 // 释放写锁（仍然持有读锁，即降级为读锁）
 *                 rwl.writeLock().unlock();
 *             }
 *         }
 *
 *         try{
 *             use(data);
 *         }finally{
 *             //释放读锁
 *             rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * 场景二：在较大的集合中，读多写少的情况
 * class RWDictionary{
 *     private final Map<String, Data> m = new TreeMap<String, Data>();
 *     private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *     private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
 *     private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();
 *
 *     public Data get(String key){
 *         r.lock();
 *         try{
 *             return m.get(key);
 *         }finally{
 *             r.unlock();
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     public String[] allKeys(){
 *         r.lock();
 *         try{
 *             return m.put(key, value);
 *         }finally{
 *             w.unlock();
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     public void clear(){
 *         w.lock();
 *         try{
 *             m.clear();
 *         }finally{
 *             w.unlock();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * 小结：
 * 1.ReentrantReadWriteLock是一种读写锁，它持有一对锁：读锁和写锁。其中读锁之间是共享的，写锁是互斥的。
 * 2.【读多写少】的场景下，ReentrantReadWriteLock比ReentrantLock有更高的并发性。
 * 3. 与ReentrantLock原理类似，ReentrantReadWriteLock内部也基于AQS：其中读锁基于【共享模式】实现，
 *    写锁基于【独占模式】实现。

             *    to avoid having to check hold count in
             *    the more typical non-reentrant case.
             * 3. If step 2 fails either because thread
             *    apparently not eligible or CAS fails or count
             *    saturated, chain to version with full retry loop.
             * 流程：
             * 1. 如果其他线程持有写锁，获取失败；
             * 2. 否则，该线程有资格获取，因此请询问它是否由于队列策略而阻塞；
             *    若不阻塞，尝试通过CAS更新状态计数。
             *    注意：这一步没有检查可重入的获取，推迟到完整版本；
             *          以避免在明显不可重入的情况下检查持有计数。
             * 3. 如果第二步失败，要么是因为线程明显不符合条件、CAS失败或计数饱和，
             *    则进行完整重试版本。
